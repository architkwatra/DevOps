# DEVOPS-10 

## Milestone-2

### Get started

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/cscdevops-spring2021/DEVOPS-10.git
```

Install the node.js packages.

```
npm install
sudo npm link
```
*Note*: 'sudo' here is used for running the command as a root user in linux (and mac). In windows you can run the command as an administrator user.

create a .vault-pass file in the DEVOPS-10 directory

```
echo csc-devops-2020 > .vault-pass
```


You can run the `pipeline setup` command to help you:

1. Provision the configuration server VM (config-srv) (with ip, sync folders)
2. Copy the .vault-pass file over the config-srv
3. Install ansible on the config server.
4. Install jenkins and its requried plugins
5. Store the github credentials passed in the command line into the jenkins credentials manager

*Note*: You must run `pipeline setup --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>` while your cwd is inside the DEVOPS-10 folder in order for the current sync path to be setup.

The output should be similiar to the following:
```bash
$ pipeline setup --gh-user user --gh-pass pass

You can also run `pipeline build iTrust -u <admin> -p <admin>` in order to:

1. Configure jenkins with the required API keys and environment variables
2. Build and run pipeline jobs for the iTrust project
3. Run all the unit and integration tests for the iTrust app

If everything is working correctly, you should see the build-pipeline jobs in the jenkins server (http://192.168.33.20:9000)

$ pipeline build iTrust -u admin -p admin

## Test suite analysis for detecting useful tests
* Performed fuzzing mutations on randomly selected java files with a certain probability for a certain number of given iterations.
* After fuzzing the tests are run to check if the mutation was successful in catching an error in the enterprise application.
* At the end, calculated the mutation coverage and printed the test cases by the order of their failed counts.

The output file can be found at ***test_suite_analysis/.test-output***

*Note*: You must run `pipeline setup --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>` while your cwd is inside the DEVOPS-10 folder.

The output should be similiar to the following:
```bash
$ pipeline useful-tests -c <count> --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>

## Static analysis for checkbox.io

* Runs the analysis on all javascript files inside of the server-side/ directory (excluding node_modules/). 
* Reports all violations discovered in the build log and fails the build if any metric exceed the threshold<br>
Violations for Checkbox.io : [Violations Report](https://github.ncsu.edu/cscdevops-spring2021/DEVOPS-10/blob/master/ViolationsReport.PNG)

## Experiences while doing the project

* We faced issues in the createCredentials API for jenkins. It has a very strict syntax and it seems it is also related to the crumb and api_token generation commands as well.
* We faced issues in the iTrust application waiting time. We are explicitly changing the pom.xml for this.
* We have faced line endings issues with .sh files while working on windows system. We had run sed cmd to resolve the issue.
* Environment variable set in the VM were not accessible from the jenkins server. Had to define variables again seperately.
* Learned to encrypt the variables and files through ansible vault, which is a great way to protect sensitive content by encrypting it instead of leaving it in plaintext.
* While working on static analysis requirements, exploring the syntax tree for sample code using the esprima parser realing helped to understand and come up with the logic to satisfy the requirements.
* We had issues while installing the jenkins plugins. Apparantly, jenkins doesn't takes some time to get its installations in line even after restarting it. We had to add an explicit pause statement after restarting jenkins.
* While performing the Test Suite Analysis, we observed that the procedure can take a lot of time for the output to show. Optimizing the process is important. One such way is to use hashsets and hashmaps for the implementation.
* While performing the Test Suite Analysis, the execution would sometimes get stuck in a repeating compilation error loop.


## Future enhancements

* Other than the milestones work, we will be changing the directory names like cm to pipeline.  
* We haven't made use of try catch blocks and our setup commands could break due to some error.
