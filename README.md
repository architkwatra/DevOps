# DEVOPS-10 

## Milestone-1

### Get started

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/cscdevops-spring2021/DEVOPS-10.git
```

Install the node.js packages.

```
npm install
sudo npm link
```
*Note*: 'sudo' here is used for running the command as a root user in linux (and mac). In windows you can run the command as an administrator user.

create a .vault-pass file in the DEVOPS-10 directory

```
echo csc-devops-2020 > .vault-pass
```


You can run the `pipeline setup` command to help you:

1. Provision the configuration server VM (config-srv) (with ip, sync folders)
2. Copy the .vault-pass file over the config-srv
3. Install ansible on the config server.
4. Install jenkins and its requried plugins

*Note*: You must run `pipeline setup` while your cwd is inside the DEVOPS-10 folder in order for the current sync path to be setup.

The output should be similiar to the following:
```bash
$ pipeline setup

*Note*: There is more to this output but has been ommitted since it is unnecessary

You can also run `pipeline build checkbox.io -u admin -p admin` in order to:

1. Configure jenkins with the required API keys and environment variables
2. Build and run pipeline jobs for the checkbox.io project
3. See the logs printed in your terminal/bash

If everything is working correctly, you should see the build-pipeline jobs in the jenkins server (http://192.168.33.20:9000)
```

$ pipeline build checkbox.io -u admin -p admin

## Experiences while doing the project

* We have faced line endings issues with .sh files while working on windows system. We had run sed cmd to resolve the issue.
* Environment variable set in the VM were not accessible from the jenkins server. Had to define variables again seperately.
* Learned to encrypt the variables and files through ansible vault, which is a great way to protect sensitive content by encrypting it instead of leaving it in plaintext. 
* We had issues while installing the jenkins plugins. Apparantly, jenkins doesn't takes some time to get its installations in line even after restarting it. We     had to add an explicit pause statement after restarting jenkins.


## Future enhancements

* Other than the milestones work, we will be changing the directory names like cm to pipeline.  
* Currently our ansible roles is not making a good use of the variables feature and we will be doing that as well in the future.
