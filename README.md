# DEVOPS-10 

## Milestone-3

### Get started

Clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/cscdevops-spring2021/DEVOPS-10.git
```

Install the node.js packages.

```
npm install
sudo npm link
```
*Note*: 'sudo' here is used for running the command as a root user in linux (and mac). In windows you can run the command as an administrator user.

create a .vault-pass file in the DEVOPS-10 directory

```
echo csc-devops-2020 > .vault-pass
```


You can run the `pipeline setup ` command to help you:

1. Provision the configuration server VM (config-srv) (with ip, sync folders)
2. Copy the .vault-pass file over the config-srv
3. Install ansible on the config server.
4. Install jenkins and its requried plugins
5. Store the github credentials passed in the command line into the jenkins credentials manager

*Note*: You must run `pipeline setup --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>` while your cwd is inside the DEVOPS-10 folder in order for the current sync path to be setup.

You can also run `pipeline prod up --secret-key $skey --access-key $akey` in order to:

1. Provision the 3 instances on AWS - iTrust, Checkbox and monitoring
2. Generate the inventory.ini file for the ansible playbooks
3. Generate the private key for connecting to theses instances

## Test suite analysis for detecting useful tests
* Performed fuzzing mutations on randomly selected java files with a certain probability for a certain number of given iterations.
* After fuzzing the tests are run to check if the mutation was successful in catching an error in the enterprise application.
* At the end, calculated the mutation coverage and printed the test cases by the order of their failed counts.

The output file can be found at ***test_suite_analysis/.test-output***

*Note*: You must run `pipeline setup --gh-user <username> --gh-pass <password>` while your cwd is inside the DEVOPS-10 folder.

The output should be similiar to the following:

## Deploying

#### *Note*: If testing things locally, the path changes in the MAC OS. Please change the paths of the actions accordingly for everything to run on MAC OS.

#### Checkbox Application

* The following steps were taken while deploying the checkbox application-

   1. Setup the environment in the cloud virtual machine.
    
   2. Installed the **agent** that uses redis to constantly publish the data to the monitoring dashboard.
    
   3. Cloned the checkbox application and ran the checkbox application using **forever** application.

* To test this yourselves, please enter the following command to deploy the checkbox application `pipeline deploy checkbox.io`.

#### iTrust Application

You can also run `pipeline deploy itrust` in order to:

1. Install iTrust related dependencies in the aws instance for iTrust
2. Deploy the war file created from the build step
3. Access the deployed iTrust application at `http://<ip_address>:8080/iTrust2`

*Important Note*: You might have to change the path of the war file created from the build command if you are a mac user. The path needs to be changed in DEVOPS-10/ansible/itrust/roles/tomcat/tasks/main.yml (Second last play of the playbook - "Copy the war file")


## Monitoring Dashboard

* Implemented a monitoring dashboard to show the metrics of the Virtual Machines for **iTrust** and **checkbox** applications where we see the following metrics-
    
    1. HTTP Status.
    
    2. Latency.
    
    3. Memory% being utilized.
    
    4. CPU% being utilized.

* Implemented this using **redis pub-sub** method where the client VMs of iTrust and checkbox applications are the publishers of the data and the monitoring dashboard application is the subscriber of that data.

* The status of each server is either **red** or **green** or **yellow**. It indicates the health of the server and is based on the score that is assigned based on their individual metrics.

* The sample output is shown here-
![img](monitor_dashboard.png)

* To test this section yourself. Please enter the following command `pipeline monitor-setup -i inventory.ini`.

## Canary Analysis

* Implemented Netflix style red-black deployment with canary analysis of a microservice.
* Created an automated analysis that can perform the following tasks and generates canary score and report
    - Constructed a computing environment with three VMs as shown in diagram (locally)
    - Generated load to the proxy server by requesting the /preview service.
    - For the first 1 minute, load is sent to the blue instance, collects health metrics.
    - Next, sends traffic to the green instance for 1 minute, collects health metrics.
    - Reports a statistical comparision between health values and computes a canary score. Finally, Determines whether canary has "passed" or "failed".

* Sample Output:

## Experiences while doing the project

* We faced issues in the createCredentials API for jenkins. It has a very strict syntax and it seems it is also related to the crumb and api_token generation commands as well.
* We faced issues in the iTrust application waiting time. We are explicitly changing the pom.xml for this.
* We have faced line endings issues with .sh files while working on windows system. We had run sed cmd to resolve the issue.
* Environment variable set in the VM were not accessible from the jenkins server. Had to define variables again seperately.
* Learned to encrypt the variables and files through ansible vault, which is a great way to protect sensitive content by encrypting it instead of leaving it in plaintext.
* While working on static analysis requirements, exploring the syntax tree for sample code using the esprima parser realing helped to understand and come up with the logic to satisfy the requirements.
* While performing the Test Suite Analysis, the execution would sometimes get stuck in a repeating compilation error loop.
* We had issues while installing the jenkins plugins. Apparantly, jenkins doesn't takes some time to get its installations in line even after restarting it. We had to add an explicit pause statement after restarting jenkins.
* While performing the Test Suite Analysis, we observed that the procedure can take a lot of time for the output to show. Optimizing the process is important. One such way is to use hashsets and hashmaps for the implementation.
* While creating the metrics dashboard, we learned about the redis usage for pub-sub where the publishers are the client VMs of checkbox and iTrust, and the subscriber is the deployed monitor VM.
* While performing the canary analysis, faced a lot of issues while geenrating load.Had to create a seperate .sh file and copy it onto the remote vm. So, that it will run successfuly.

## Future enhancements

* Other than the milestones work, we will be changing the directory names like cm to pipeline.  
* We haven't made use of try catch blocks and our setup commands could break due to some error.
